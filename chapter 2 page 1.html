<header id="header1">GLOBAL AND EUROPEAN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (Co2)</header>
<p id="para2">
The 2018 increase reflects the fact that improvements in carbon intensity and energy intensity were not enough to offset the effects of economic growth .However, the effect of global economic growth in 2018 (3%, slightly higher than 2.8% per year averaged over 2013 - 2017) more than offset these improvements.Many regions contributed to the increase in global emissions  
</p>  
<header class="header2"> CHINA </header>
<p id="para3">China's estimated CO2 emissions grew by around 2.2% in 2018, although historical Chinese energy statistics are often subject to substantial revisions. This increase was driven by emissions from the burning of coal, supplemented with increasing oil and gas consumption</p>
    
<header class="header3">USA</header> 
<p id="para4"> 
 The USA's CO2 emissions increased 2.6% in 2018, driven in part by relatively large heating and cooling demands of a cold winter and warm summer along with strong economic growth. US CO2 emissions are projected to fall in 2019 and 2020 by a leading US energy agency. </p>
    
<header class="header4">INDIA</header>
<p id ="para5">
India's CO2 emissions grew strongly at 7% in 2018, underpinned by strong economic growth. Although renewable energy deployment continues rapidly, it is being outstripped by energy demand growth, leading to rapidly growing coal consumption.    
</p>    
<header class="header5">EU</header>
<p id = "para6"> 
In the EU emissions of CO2 decreased by about 2% in 2018 relative to 2017 levels,the first fall since 2014.

<header class="header6">SUMMARY OF GREENHOUSE gas EMISSIONS (Co2)</header>
<div class="co2emissions"> 
<p id = "para7">to make matters worse  In 2017, 56% of aggregated global GHG emissions came from China (27%), the USA (13%), the EU (9%) and India (7%), the four biggest emitters.3The Rest of the World  also increased CO2 emissions in 2018 by 1.7% on 2017 levels.
Projected economic growth for 2019 at around 2.6%33 will tend to drive a continued increase in global CO2 and GHG emissions this year. However, with falling costs of renewable energy, increasing retirements of coal capacity and pledged efforts to reduce emissions, there is potential for the trend to be reversed Actions in the UK to set and pursue vigorously ambitious emissions reduction targets can help support an increase in global effort to start reducing emissions. Already the UK is sending positive international signals by demonstrating that it is possible to cut emissions while growing the economy and to run a power system without relying on coal. </p>

<header class="header7"> OTHER GREENHOUSE  GAS  EMISSIONS </header>    
<p id="para8">   
 •The Rest of the World  also increased CO2 emissions in 2018 by 1.7% on 2017 levels. Global aggregated GHG emissions (using GWP100 values from the IPCC 4th Assessment Report) rose 1.3% in 2017 (the latest year available) to 55.1 GtCO2e per year when including emissions from land-use change. <br> <br> 

•Anthropogenic methane (CH4) emissions increased to 9.3 GtCO2e per year (a 1.2% increase on 2016 levels), with China accounting for one-third of the increase. There were particularly large increases in global emissions from coal production (4.2%) and natural gas transmission (3.3%)<br> <br>

• Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions rose to 3.0 GtCO2e per year (a 1.4% increase). Manure and fertilizer use were the largest sources contributing to this increase. The largest regional increase in N2O emissions was in India.<br><br>

• F-gas emissions continued to grow, increasing 4.1% in 2017, but slower than in recent years (5.6% per year on average over 2004 - 2014). F-gas emissions reached 1.6 GtCO2e per year in 2017 with HFCs making up two-thirds of this total.<br> <br>

<p id="para9">Global energy demand grew by 2.9% in 2018, its largest increase since 2010.34 China, India and the USA together accounted for over two-thirds of the global increase. Large demands for heating and cooling due to weather effects contributed significantly to this large increase in energy demand (estimated to be around one-quarter of the annual growth)

<p id="para10">
Global coal capacity and generation both grew in 2018. Consumption grew at the fastest rate since 2013, but capacity is growing at a slowing rate with 51 GW of new capacity added and 31 GW retired across the globe Globally, the pipeline of planned future coal plants has shrunk by over 60% since 2015 as the falling costs and rising deployment of renewables is changing the cost competitiveness of new coal plants

was the energy source (across high carbon and low carbon sources) that grew the most in 2018, growing at the fastest rate since 2010. This indicates both the increasing demand for energy around the world and switching between coal and gas. It accounted for over 40% of the net increase in global energy demand

 consumption grew in 2018 increasing by 1.5% above 2017 levels. This was slightly slower than the 1.7% increase in 2017 (above 2016 levels), in part due to higher oil prices.

generation increased by 2.4% in 2018, but its share of electricity generation remained largely unchanged (10%) due to growing global electricity demand. China accounted for about 75% of the increase

<p id="conclusion2">
Future trends in the global energy system indicate that the strong growth of renewables is expected to continue. However, emissions from fossil fuel combustion are also generally expected to continue to grow slowly over the next decade due to rising gas and oil demand alongside broadly constant coal consumption.
