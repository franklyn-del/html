The 24th Conference of Parties (COP24) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held in Katowice, Poland in December 2018.The rulebook for the Paris Agreement was largely completed at COP24. This provides the internationally agreed rules and processes to operationalise the Paris Agreement.

<div id ="divnum3">

<li class="list2"> •Rules for harmonising future Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs  national commitments to emissions reductions prior to 2030), creating a common system for expressing and comparing pledged mitigation commitments.   </li>

Agreement on rules for international market-based mechanisms to share mitigation efforts and accounted emissions reductions between countries could not be reached so will be returned to this year.to add to this Several countries and regions around the world are setting or considering net-zero emissions targets. As set out in our Net Zero report, these include the European Union, California, France, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and New Zealand</li>

<li class="list2"> France has formalised its target for net-zero GHG emission by 2050 into law, becoming the second G7 country (after the UK) to do so </li>   
    
<li class="list2">

The Finnish government has committed to legislate to become carbon-neutral by 2035, intending not to rely on the use of imported emissions credits. ‒ Ireland has announced an aspirational target for net-zero emissions by 2050 as part of its Climate Action Plan, which includes a proposal for a new Climate Act. Over 180 actions are also included within the plan to move the country back towards a path to achieve its climate goals The Finnish government has committed to legislate to become carbon-neutral by 2035, intending not to rely on the use of imported emissions credits</li>
    
<li class="list2"> The government of Japan has approved a plan to reach 'a carbon neutral society' as early as possible in the second half of the century </li>
<li class="list2">The government of New Zealand has proposed an amendment bill to legislate to reduce all greenhouse gases (except biogenic methane) to net zero by 2050 and to reduce emissions of biogenic methane within the range of 24 – 47% below 2017 levels by 2050

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is now beginning the first 'ambition round' under the Paris Agreement, with all countries required by the end of 2020 to resubmit their first NDC. Countries are also required to submit 'long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies' (focused on mid-century) by the same date. The UK should aim to maximise the international impact of setting a net-zero emissions target to help move the world towards a lower-carbon future at this crucial time in the international process

<header class = "header17"> Milestones reached</header>
<ol>
<li class="list1"> The UN Climate Action Summit, to be held in New York on 23 September 2019. This offers the first opportunity for countries to gather and signal their intentions for increasing NDC ambition. The UK is leading a focus area on climate resilience at this summit</li>
    
<li class="list1"> The publication of IPCC special reports on Climate Change and Land and The Ocean and the Cryosphere in a Changing Climate in August and September 2019 respectively, which will inform negotiations at COP25.</li>
    
<li class="list1">COP25 in Chile in December 2019, which will offer another opportunity for countries to communicate enhanced NDCs. It will have a particular focus on the effect of climate change on the oceans.</li>   

<li class ="list1">COP26 (at the end of 2020), which is expected to be the major focus point for efforts to raise NDC ambition. It now appears probable that the UK will host the COP26 talks, having agreed a partnership bid with Italy. These are crucial talks and represent a major opportunity to increase global effort and ambition to cut emissions. The UK should use all the tools at its disposal to ensure that these talks are successful. The UK is currently represented in the international process by the EU NDC.</li>
    
<li class="list1"> Agreement on EUwide targets for renewable energy, energy efficiency and governance in 2018 suggest that the EU would be able to increase its NDC ambition to at least a 45% reduction in GHG emissions relative to 1990 levels</li>   
</ol>  

<p id="conclusion3">
 Several member states and the EU Parliament have called for the EU to signal increased NDC ambition by the time of the UN Climate Action Summit in September, but this will require unanimous agreement in the Council of Ministers. Upon leaving the EU, the UK is likely to require its own NDC for emissions reduction to 2030. This could initially be set, at the very least, at the level of the fifth carbon budget,44 and should then be strengthened based on the more ambitious pathway required to reach net-zero GHG emissions in 2050 that the Committee will advise on in 2020. Delivering effective policies to connect near-term ambition with the net-zero long-term target will be essential for the UK to show international leadership as the expected COP26 host
